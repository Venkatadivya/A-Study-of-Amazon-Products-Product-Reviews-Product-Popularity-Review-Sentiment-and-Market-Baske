# A-Study-of-Amazon-Products-Product-Reviews-Product-Popularity-Review-Sentiment-and-Market-Basket


Daily tasks like online purchases, energy bill payments, watching the latest movies, conversing, etc. are being sped up and changed by the internet. Markets must offer a variety of goods and services to clients with a range of requirements if they are to remain competitive. Retailers and manufacturers now have their products to customers' needs while offering more options than previously available due to the transition to online purchasing. The purpose of this study is to analyze how end users (both consumers and enterprises) can profit from recommender systems/sentiment analysis/Market basket analysis by quickly discovering the right products. Building a model with Lexicon Vader to analyze the sentiment score of customer reviews is the initial objective. The second objective is to create a recommender system for new Amazon users using user ratings, product categories, and User IDs. The third goal is to develop an analysis of the market basket for new Amazon users using the product title, product categories, and user IDs.
